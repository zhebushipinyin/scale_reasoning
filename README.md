## Overview

DeepScaleR is an open-source project to fully democratize reinforcement learning (RL) for LLMs and reproduce DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI O1/O3 at scale on real tasks. For all releases, we open source all our efforts here-including training scripts (including hyperparameters), models, dataset, and logs.

## Releases  📰

<strong>[2025/02/10]</strong> We release `DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview`, a 1.5B model that surpasses O1-Preview and achieves <strong>43.1% Pass@1</strong> on AIME. We achieve this by iteratively scaling Deepseek's GRPO algorithm from 8K→16K->24K context length for thinking. As part of this release, we open-source:

  - Due to Wandb migration bugs, the 8k training run is compressed to 400-500 steps. The data is identical, but our original run was 1600 steps.

## Getting Started 🎯
### Installation
```bash
# Recommend Python 3.10.
cd deepscaler
pip install -e ./verl
pip install -e .
```

### Data
Our raw training data in `deepscaler/data/[train|test]`, along with preprocessing scripts. To convert the raw data into Parquet files for training, run:
```python
# Output parquet files in data/*.parquet.
python scripts/data/deepscaler_dataset.py
```

### Training Scripts

We provide training scripts for both single-node and multi-node setups in `scripts/train/`. Our runs' Wandb logs are available [here](https://wandb.ai/mluo/deepscaler-1.5b).

#### Single-Node Training (8 GPUs)
Our 8k context script runs on a single node with 8 A100-80GB GPUs:
```bash
# Set XFormers backend to avoid CUDA errors
export VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=XFORMERS
# Run 8K context length training
export MODEL_PATH="deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B"
./scripts/train/run_deepscaler_1.5b_8k.sh --model $MODEL_PATH
```

#### Multi-Node Training (32 GPUs)

Our long-context runs (16K/24K) are distributed across 4 nodes with 8 A100-80GB GPUs each. To run, follow these steps:

1. On the head node:
```bash
# Set XFormers backend to avoid CUDA errors
export VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=XFORMERS
# Start Ray head node
ray start --head
```

2. On each worker node:
```bash
# Set XFormers backend to avoid CUDA errors
export VLLM_ATTENTION_BACKEND=XFORMERS
# Connect to head node (replace with your head node's address)
ray start --address=[RAY_ADDRESS]
```

3. Finally, on the head node, run the training script:
```bash
# Run 16K or 24K context length training
./scripts/train/run_deepscaler_1.5b_[16k|24k].sh --model [CHECKPOINT_PATH]
```
We welcome the community to try out different models, context legnths, and RL parameters in the training scripts!

### Ablations

Finally, we provide ablations for the 2k/4k context runs in `scripts/ablation/`. To run:
```bash
./scripts/ablation/run_deepscaler_1.5b_[2k|4k].sh --model [CHECKPOINT_PATH]
```

## Evaluation

Our evaluation scripts automatically runs vLLM to generate 16 samples for each problem. To run our evaluation scripts, run:
```bash
./scripts/eval/eval_model.sh --model [CHECKPOINT_PATH] --datasets [DATASET1] [DATASET2] --output-dir [OUTPUT_DIR]
```

We report Pass@1 accuracy averaged over 16 samples for each problem. Notably, our `DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview` surpasses many open-source 7B models! Our evaluation logs are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V_rYKoL35WmubbmWN6PeFg4zo5QOug8X/view?pli=1).
